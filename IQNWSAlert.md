# Introduction #

The Weather Channel's alert notification feature is nice, but it's based on the "old" way the National Weather Service issued alerts.  It also only alerts you if the phone is active.  So if a severe storm warning is issued for your county, you won't find out about it until you do something with the phone.  This application takes another approach.

**Neither this application nor its developers have any association with the US National Weather Service, nor does the NWS endorse this application in any way.**<br />

In recent years, the United States National Weather Service (NWS) has started to use polygons to issue weather alerts.  This is in addition to the county-based alerts that activate weather radios.  Unfortunately, if you're in a county that encompasses a few thousand square miles, you may get an alert for an area that is far away from you.  For example, if you lived in Bakersfield in Kern county California, would you want to be woken up at 2am for an alert that only affects a 500 square mile area around North Edwards?  Probably not, unless you had family there.

On the other hand, wouldn't you like to know, within a few minutes, that a tornado warning was issued for where you are, even if you haven't touched the phone in an hour?  Probably, even at 2am.  That's why this application exists.  To provide you with alerts, that meet your criteria, and affect the location where you are.

It relies on Internet connectivity of the device upon which it runs to retrieve alerts as well as the ability of that device to determine your location.  **DO NOT RELY ON THIS APPLICATION TO NOTIFY YOU OF A THREATENING SITUATION.**  There are many possible failure points in the system upon which this application relies.  Be sure to have alternate methods to receive NWS alerts.

**NOTE also:** The usual open-source disclaimers apply.  Most specifically and especially:  The developers of this application do not intend this to be a primary alerting mechanism for severe weather.  The developers are not responsible in any way if this application fails to notify you.
