	<string name="about_summary">This application came to me one day following a
		Skywarn briefing by a local NWS meteorologist. Some NWS offices
		started issuing alerts recently where the alert area is related to
		storm characteristics rather than just the counties affected. This
		application takes that information and your current location to
		determine whether an alert is active for your location.
